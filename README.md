# Zig GameKit 2D
Companion repo and example implementation for [zig-renderkit](https://github.com/prime31/zig-renderkit). `GameKit` provides an example implementation of a game framework built on top of `RenderKit`. It includes the core render loop, window (via SDL), input, Dear ImGui and timing support. You can use it as a base to make a 2D game as-is or create your own 2D framework based on it.

`GameKit` provides the following wrappers around `RenderKit`'s API showing how it can be abstracted away in a real world project: `Texture`, `Shader` and `OffscreenPass`. Building on top of those types, `GameKit` then provides `Mesh` and `DynamicMesh` which manage buffers and bindings for you. Finally, the high level types utilize `DynamicMesh` and cover pretty much all that any 2D game would require: `Batcher` (quad/sprite batch) and `TriangleBatcher`.

Some basic utilities and a small math lib with just the types required for the renderer (`Vec2`, `Vec3`, `Color`, `3x2 Matrix`, `Quad`) are also included.


## Dependencies
GameKit has just one external dependency: SDL. You can install SDL with the package manager of your choice. On macOS if you intend to use the Metal renderer you will need to build from source until the next SDL release drops.


### Usage
- clone the repository recursively: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit`
- `zig build help` to see what examples are availble
- `zig build EXAMPLE_NAME` to run an example


### Minimal GameKit Project File
```zig
var texture: Texture = undefined;

pub fn main() !void {
    try gamekit.run(.{ .init = init, .render = render });
}

fn init() !void {
    texture = Texture.initFromFile(std.testing.allocator, "texture.png", .nearest) catch unreachable;
}

fn render() !void {
    gamekit.gfx.beginPass(.{ .color = Color.lime });
    gamekit.gfx.draw.tex(texture, .{ .x = 50, .y = 50 });
    gamekit.gfx.endPass();
}
```
